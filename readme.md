# Rest Api Demo

This is demo project that uses [zcwilt/rest-api](https://github.com/zcwilt/rest-api)

At the moment it simply provides some routes and some links on the home page to test the API 


## Installation 

Clone the project 

``git clone https://github.com/zcwilt/rest-api-demo.git``

cd into the project directory and do 

``composer update``

then

php artisan migrate

serve the project however you normally do, using serve or valet

The home page will show links that use various filters.

## Coming Soon

Will show how to use the Api Controllers to allow with authorization/versions etc
